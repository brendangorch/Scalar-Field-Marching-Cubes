# Scalar-Field-Marching-Cubes
A C++ program that uses OpenGL to generate triangle meshes from scalar fields using Marching Cubes.
<br />
<br />
<br />

## How to Run
- Use vcpkg to link the necessary libraries (glew, glfw, glm), or download the libraries and link them statically.
- Inside of the Exercise1.cpp file, you can edit functions f1 and f2 to encode any scalar field to be rendered.
- Upon running Exercise1.cpp, the mesh will be generated and written to a .ply file.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to zoom in and out, and left click with the mouse to rotate the volume.

## The Code
I built my own implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm in MarchingCubes.cpp. I created a Phong lighting model using custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders to visualize the algorithmâ€™s output. A camera system was designed using spherical coordinates for interactive 3D scene rotation. Additionaly, I developed a utility function for exporting the meshes to PLY file format.
